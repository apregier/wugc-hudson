SYMLINKS:
current/pipeline    The default snapshot for the cron/pipeline. (Must pass model tests and build diffs.)
current/user        The in the new PERL5LIB and PATH for users. (Must pass the test suite.)
current/web         The default snapshot for the web interface. (Typically matches stable-user).

SUB-DIRECTORIES:
snapshots/custom    Snapshots which have been custom built, e.g. hotfixes.
snapshots/old       Snapshots which have been superceded and which have no running builds.
snapshots/stable    Snapshots which have passed tests and builds.
snapshots/tested    Snapshots which have passed tests but not builds.
snapshots/unstable  Snapshots which have failed tests.

Naming convention:
    genome-$hudsonbuild
or
    genome-$hudsonbuild-fixM

Each Hudson build contains a file called revisions.txt which contains the revision numbers for all repos at that build.
In addition, the genome.git repository gets a tag for Hudson build N like "genome-N".
